    'about_us_p1' => 'Islands Cafe has locations in White Rock and South Surrey. It is a privately owned Cafe and Roaster. The main focus is freshly Roasted Hawaiian Coffee, and a few “Surf Culture” staples such as: The North Shore Acai Bowl, The Kahuku Poke Bowl, and The Honolua Breakfast Sandwich.Providing a healthy alternative to most fast food and Café chains with the absolute Best Coffee you will ever have. Islands Café is a Taste of Paradise ® “Ja and I wanted to share what we loved about Hawaii with our local community. The food, the Drinks and the Surf Culture all in one place. “',
    'history' => 'HISTORY',
    'about_us_p2' => 'When I left Vancouver I knew nothing about surfing, or even if I would like it. My earliest memories are of growing up in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. While most kids were dreaming of the NHL, I was dreaming of getting perfect barrels somewhere tropical. The only surfing outlet I remember at that age was a Surfer Magazine my friend’s dad had brought home with him from a vacation he went on to California. Those images are still burned into my mind much like the many great rides I had during my time spent in Hawaii. One of surfing and Hawaii’s ambassadors Makua Rothman is often heard saying when asked about the over crowded tourism now plaguing the North Shore, “Come visit our beautiful Islands and enjoy their Aloha sprit of Hawaii, but please don’t forget to go home.” In 2008 I felt it was my time to go home. Five years of paradise, and just like that I was back in White Rock, BC.',
    'about_us_p3' => 'The time I spent in Hawaii was amazing, the people I met even more amazing, and the food, drinks, and culture are a huge part of who I am today. I enjoy healthy, good, clean tasting food, that is served fast and contains quality ingredients. That part of me will never change and therefore Islands Café was created. My wife Jalene who also spent a lot of time in Hawaii with me, joined me in this venture to give our community of White Rock a Café they could be stoked about. The Café focuses on the main staples we loved while in Hawaii, they are all super nutritious and all taste amazing.',
    'about_us_p4' => 'The first big hurtle was finding the exact recipe to make our Poke taste exactly like the Kahuku Superette\'s.',
    'about_us_p5' => 'Poke Bowls were a way of life in Hawaii. If you surfed everyday, which most North Shore residents did, the body needed real energy - it craves it. The lean and clean Ahi provides the best protein to heal sore and torn muscle fibers, and the taste is undeniable. Many trips east to the town of Kahuku to grab a Poke Bowl and a cold beer from the Superette after a long surf somewhere along the 7-mile.',
    'about_us_p6' => 'Our most popular item at Islands Café is the North Shore Acai Bowl. For five months I worked in the most popular smoothie shack in Hawaii, and as far as I know the first to bring the Brazilian berry bowl to Hawaii. They all came, John John Florence, Kelly Slater, Jack Johnson, even movie stars would show up like Tom Hanks, and Adam Sandler for an Acai Bowl. But mostly it was the local surfers who lined up daily to get there fix of healthy glucose sugars, and organic granola giving their bodies the needed energy to charge massive waves.',
    'about_us_p7' => 'The North Shore was also known for some really amazing parties. The big charity events at Wiamea Bay, reggae nights in Haleiwa, or The annual Lifeguard Party on Halloween. The next morning you were hurting and the best place for comfort food was Ted’s Bakery at Sunset Beach for a breakfast sandwich and Kona coffee.',
    'about_us_p8' => '>Our Ted’s breakfast sandwich is a more healthy version of the original but we kept the main ingredients the same and our coffee is always 100% Hawaiian.',
    'about_us_p9' => 'One of our newest additions to our Cafe is our Roaster, which will now allow us to bring you a more local product with the same Hawaiian origins.',
    'about_us_p10'=> 'Whether you have been to Hawaii or not, Islands Café will be an experience that will keep you coming back. Our goal is to provide all our customers with a higher quality of food, drink, and atmosphere. Come check us out and let us know your thoughts on any of our social media channels.',
